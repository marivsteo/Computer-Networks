Project simulating a Computer Network similar to the internet. <br>
The image representing the network was given, along with the IP of the network. <br>
I computed the correct mask and IPs for every subnetwork and connected them in Cisco Packet Tracer.<br>
It contains: NAT, DHCP server and router, WEB server, Wi-fi router, access point and many more. <br>
The final result was that every device was accesible from any other device in the network.<br>
Also, I had 2 different approaches, one using static routing and the other using RIPv2.<br>
